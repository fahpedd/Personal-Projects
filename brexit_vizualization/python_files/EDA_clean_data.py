# ###### Economic development indicators
# To assess the economic development of a country, geographers use economic indicators including:
# 
# * Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total value of goods and services produced by a country in a year.
# * Gross National Product (GNP) measures the total economic output of a country, including earnings from foreign investments.
# * GNP per capita is a country's GNP divided by its population. (Per capita means per person.)
# * Economic growth measures the annual increase in GDP, GNP, GDP per capita, or GNP per capita.
# * Inequality of wealth is the gap in income between a country's richest and poorest people. It can be measured in many ways, (eg the proportion of a country's wealth owned by the richest 10 per cent of the population, compared with the proportion owned by the remaining 90 per cent).
# * Inflation measures how much the prices of goods, services and wages increase each year. High inflation (above a few percent) can be a bad thing, and suggests a government lacks control over the economy.
# * Unemployment is the number of people who cannot find work.
# * Economic structure shows the division of a country's economy between primary, secondary and tertiary industries.
# * Demographics study population growth and structure. It compares birth rates to death rates, life expectancy and urban and rural ratios. Many LEDCs have a younger, faster-growing population than MEDCs, with more people living in the countryside than in towns. The birth rate in the UK is 11 per 1,000, whereas in Kenya it is 40.

# 1.	Crude birth rate and death rate per year
# 2.	Life expectancy total and compare with male and female per year
# 3.	Population Vs GDP use year as hue. GDP has dropped as population increased. 2007 was the most than fell during recession.  2014 and than dropped again
# 4.	Divide GDP growth or amount into two groups and plot one beside the other. Year from 1973 â€“ 1994, 1995-2017
# 5.	Imports vs exports.. imports have increased than exports
# 6.	Merchandise imports and exports of UK. Have an eye on the y-axis. Imports for agriculture, food and fuel are more than exports. Manufacturing and ores exports are more than imports.
# 7.	Commercial service: Insurance and Computer import is higher than exports but travel and transport services import is higher than exports. Both 5 and 6 means that poor and people not living in urban area were more hit.
# 8.	% or rural and % of urban is a better indicator because of the same scale. Make a plot with numbers and say it is not good. Plot rural vs another with hue as year and it shows that there is a decrease 
# 9.	Youth unemployment : most affected with 2004 starting unlike just around recession. Check for other countries
# 10.	Part time employment for females is twice as much as for males. No need for labour participation
