This paper addresses the challenge of predicting
mortgage arrears at the county level for Ireland. Unlike the
other works literature which focus on individual mortgages data
about borrowers or exploratory analysis of lenderâ€™s data, the
paper presents both supervised and unsupervised data mining
techniques on openly available data. The extensive experiments
conducted for the paper show that it is possible to distinguish
neighbouring counties from counties which are away from each
other, classify provinces and predict the amount of annual
arrear using derived factors from economic and census data.
The benefits include an addition to the academic literature
regarding arrears and the use of features and model by local
authorities, lenders or the government to successfully predict
the arrears and plan for the future.
